It is likely we will have to make mate coefficient less than population size. In generation 10 -> 11, the top individual in gen 10 had a fractional pooling layer. In generation 11, we got very lucky and got a near 5% increase in fitness with a good mutation in the training block, but that nearly wiped out half of our population. This will almost certainly lead to population stagnation as all of the base 12 population becomes stuck with the single kind of training block and prevents further evolution (relies solely on mutation within a limited main_count genome size).

To counteract this eventual genetic stagnation, we must either decrease the mating coefficient as a percentage of base population (or "kept" population). Otherwise, one extremely good block could potentially wipe out an entire population's genetic diversity in one generation.
